# Java-Practice
## This repo is for an assignment for SDEV 301 - Systems Programming, where I review my skills for Maps and Instances.

### There are two .java files; one called "Store" which is the Main Class, the second is "ShoppingCart" where you'll find the instance, constructors, and HashMaps.
### This program is suppose to be simulated Online Shopping Cart, where I use a instance called "Shopping Cart" which maintains it's own cart where a HashMap holds keys as "Items" and the values as "Price."

## GIVE IT A SHOT! :D
